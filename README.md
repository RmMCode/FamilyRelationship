# FamilyRelationship
% This project models the song 'I'm My Own Grandpa' in Prolog using family facts and defining kinship rules/relationships like parent, step-parent, in-laws, grandparents, and siblings. 

% The program verifies these claims in the song by creating logical queries.

% This project and all of its contributions was done by me only: Rishit Maiti 
% Wrote all code in one .pl file (project4.pl) and created a report within 3 pages maximum
